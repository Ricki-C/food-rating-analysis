      <td>Being a  huge fan of America's Test Kitchen  I just had  to try this and I am  sure glad I did. It is really good. Sweet  corn is  just  coming in season here  and I have  chives in my herb garden so I had all the  best ingredients. I did  use a Jalapeno from the  garden instead of the  habanero. I  just made this and I plan to have it with some chicken. I'll  bet you could use some nice peaches to change it up a bit.      Thanks for posting .</td>

      <td>wow red and white sweetness!  DH loved them , I found them a bit two sweet for me but a nice change to serve strawberries.  very easy recipe, but I think 8 ounces of strawvberries is not enough, if I make them again I will double the strawberries and use about half of the cool whip. (I use light cool whip.)  Thanks for posting.</td>
